# Introduction
## What is Algebraeon?

Algebraeon is a computer algebra system written in Rust.

This guide is for the Python module `algebraeon` which provides a more user-friendly interface to the capabilities of Algebraeon.

## Stability

The API is subject to large breaking changes at this time. I hope to stabilize things more in the not too distant future.
