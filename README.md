# Algebraeon (Python Module)

This is a Python wrapper around [the Rust library of the same name](https://github.com/pishleback/Algebraeon).

It currently supports only a _very_ small subset of the capabilities of the Rust library. Once it has been better fleshed out it will be the recommended way to use Algebraeon for people who care more about maths than software.

The latest release is published to PyPI [here](https://pypi.org/project/algebraeon/).

There is [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Join%20Chat-7289DA?logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.gg/DBqbPqPMKR) for informal discussions about Algebraeon.

See the [User Guide](https://pishleback.github.io/Algebraeon-Python/) to get started using Algebraeon with Python.
