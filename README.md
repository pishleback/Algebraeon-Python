# Algebraeon (Python Module)

This is a Python wrapper around [the Rust libraryof the same name](https://github.com/pishleback/Algebraeon).

It currently supports only a _very_ small subset of the capabilities of the Rust library. Development is ongoing and the Python module is in a very young state, but once more fleshed out it will be the recommended way to use Algebraeon for people who care more about maths than software.
